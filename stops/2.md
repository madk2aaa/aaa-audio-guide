TEST
 

Located on the edge of the Gobi Desert and at the crossroads of the ancient Silk Road, the Dunhuang Caves facilitated the flow of trade goods and knowledge across religious, ethnic, and linguistic cultures from the fourth to the fourteenth centuries. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, the Dunhuang Caves, also known as the Mogao (“peerless”) Grottoes, feature thousands of years of Buddhist paintings and sculptures, as well as a vast archive that documents this period. The following conversation with Nilima Sheikh was conducted by AAA Researcher Sneha Ragavan and AAA Public Programmes Lead Özge Ersoy, in conjunction with the exhibition Lines of Flight: Nilima Sheikh Archive, on view at Asia Art Archive from 22 March to 30 June 2018.
